            <p>
              React is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where fast, dynamic, and interactive experiences are required. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render based on changing data. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the browser DOM. Its component-based architecture makes code more organized and easier to maintain. React is widely used in modern web development due to its flexibility, strong community support, and compatibility with other tools and frameworks like Redux, Next.js, and TypeScript.
